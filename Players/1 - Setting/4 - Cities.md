# Cities of Aiti

The main continent of Aiti is roughly similar to the continent of Eurasia on earth, if you absolutely must think of it that way. There are four main cities, each defining a Land, roughly akin to a country.

## Delta, Land of the Water

- In the west
- Names pulled roughly from celtic languages
- Should be vaguely reminiscent of england and western europe
- Ruled by the Depressed Queen
- A visual combination between Venice waterways and New Orleans bayous, is a major port city, majority of travel within the city is by boat or ferry
- Inhabitants are calm and peaceful, going with the flow like the movement of their surrounding rivers, streams, and waterways

## Canopy, Land of the Forest

- In the north
- Domain of The Life
- Combination of extensive meadows and glens, and a lush valley where the Greatmother Tree is centered
- Inhabitants are jovial, dressed in attire similar to faeries, and are very protective of life and each other

Canopy is less a city in the traditional sense and more of a set of villages in close proximity that decided to work together for the common good. It is dominated by the Greatmother Tree, which since the death of The Life has become a sort of *de facto* city hall and place of government. 

Several enclaves of druids call Canopy and the surrounding areas their home, and the largest remaining enclave of the Children of Life make their home next to the Greatmother Tree. When The Life was alive and the Portal of Portals still operational, the tree glowed with the constant magic running through it, but now it almost seems to wilt. 

Architecture in Canopy is designed to incorporate the plant life as much as possible. Most houses are made by finding branches that are already close together and weaving a roof out of dead leaves, then sealing it with magic. There's very little metal in use in Canopy, partly due to the lack of need, but also due to the druidic aversion to it. 

The main patron of Canopy is the unnamed Great Mage who created Canopy, but many will pray to the patron of their particular Circle, or to The Life.

## Sun's Reach, Land of the Sun

- In the south
- Africa
- Physical area maintains large grasslands, similar to the serengeti, and the sky maintains rich reds and oranges that mimic the images of the inhabitants
- Inhabitants have an affinity with the Light Domain, very proud and strong-willed people
- Architecture within Land of the Sun mimics buildings and structures within interconnected cities and metropolitan areas. Travel between the smaller cities are facilitated by use of magics to turn people into flashes of light and transporting themselves from one area to another; at night, travelers can be seen mimicking shooting stars of streaking meteors in the sky
- Bantu languages

## Skymeet, Land of the Sky

The last of the four great Lands to be founded, Skymeet is the capital city of the Land of the Sky. It sits on the slopes of a mountain range, the bottom tier built into the mountains themselves, and the upper tier floating hundreds of feet above, shining like a beacon for miles. The city is a massive trading hub, with much of the lower tier dominated by artisans and merchants, and much of the upper tier dominated by The Academy, the second-largest school dedicated to the study of magic on Aiti.

The areas around Skymeet are mostly filled with farms, though there is a fair amount of mining. The Land ends quite abruptly at the edge of the Mother Forest, as the people have a great deal of respect for the lands within.

Skymeet, and the Land of the Sky, are governed by King Terrence and Queen Miranda, with a court comprised mostly of citizens of note. There isn't a noble class to speak of, and most people are invited to the Court for reasons of merit, rather than some sort of luck of being born. In the past, there hasn't been much in the way of politics for the sake of politics, but there has been a growing trend of those vying for positions in the Court by performing deeds mostly for show, rather than any sort of altruism.

The city of Skymeet itself has a strong affinity for the domain of Knowledge, but the surrounding areas tend to favour Life. Citizens of the city tend to pray to Haneul, the Great Mage who raised the upper tier of the city when it was getting overcrowded.
