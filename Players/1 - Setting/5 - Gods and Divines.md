# God and Divines

There are only three beings in the world of Aiti that could be truly considered divine:

1. Aiti herself
2. The Life
3. The Land

Since Aiti is too powerful, The Life is dead, and The Land is lost, clerics and paladins instead worship and draw power from the Great Mages, beings raised to immense power, chosen by Aiti herself to perform a Great Work. Once their work is completed, though, they are too powerful to remain near mortals, and they vanish. Only a handful such beings have existed over the millennia, and they're listed here.

## P'thael

**Alignment**: Chaotic Good

**Domain**: Nature

**Great Work**: Created The Mother Forest, a huge, evergreen forest, resilient to almost every form of damage, taking up most of the central continent.

## Name not specified yet

**Alignment**: Neutral Good

**Domain**: Nature

**Great Work**: Grew the Greatmother Tree, which formed the town of Canopy. This extended the Mother Forest, and created two enclaves, one for the druids, and one for the Children of Life. The Life, while they lived, lived in the Greatmother Tree.

## Hrodwyn, Shaper of the Land

**Alignment**: Lawful Neutral

**Domain**: Diplomacy

**Great Work**: Prevented a budding war between Delta and Sun's Reach by creating The Chasm, a once-valley, now massive river, preventing the armies from crossing.
