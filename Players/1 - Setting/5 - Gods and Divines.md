# God and Divines

There are only three beings in the world of Aiti that could be truly considered divine:

1. Aiti herself
2. The Life
3. The Land

Since Aiti is too powerful, The Life is dead, and The Land is lost, clerics and paladins instead worship and draw power from the Great Mages, beings raised to immense power, chosen by Aiti herself to perform a Great Work. Once their work is completed, though, they are too powerful to remain near mortals, and they vanish. Only a handful such beings have existed over the millennia, and they're listed here.

## P'thael

**Alignment**: Chaotic Good

**Domain**: Nature

**Great Work**: Created The Mother Forest, a huge, evergreen forest, resilient to almost every form of damage, taking up most of the central continent.

## Vyr, the Woodwaker

**Alignment**: Neutral Good

**Domain**: Nature

**Great Work**: Grew the Greatmother Tree, which formed the town of Canopy. This extended the Mother Forest, and created two enclaves, one for the druids, and one for the Children of Life. The Life, while they lived, lived in the Greatmother Tree.

Vyr is one of the few Great Mages who is occasionally seen on Aiti. They will sometimes manifest deep in the Mother Forest, usually far out of reach, always appearing as a humanoid with caribou antlers, with the legs of a heron, wearing a cloak of loam and a wooden mask, carrying a walking stick. They are known to cause out of season blooms, and capricious changes in the weather. Some say that they will rearrange the Mother Forest to confuse the unworthy. 

Since the death of The Life, Vyr has been spotted fairly frequently in the boughs of the Greatmother Tree, standing still, watching. When noticed, they will stare into the eyes of whoever is looking at them and begin to fade away. Most consider this terrifying.

## Hrodwyn, Shaper of the Land

**Alignment**: Lawful Neutral

**Domain**: Diplomacy

**Great Work**: Prevented a budding war between Delta and Sun's Reach by creating The Chasm, a once-valley, now massive river, preventing the armies from crossing.

## Levotta, Goddess of Fear

**Alignment**: Chaotic Evil

**Domain**: Shadow

**Great Work**: Created the concept of fear and shared it with the world of Aiti, just because she could.

## Frances, the Death Guide

**Alignment**: Lawful Neutral

**Domain**: Death

**Great Work**: One of the first of the Great Mages, Frances found out that those who died were left to rot, so she demanded that she be allowed to fix it. She went to The Life, made her case, and Aiti granted her power. She then created the two planes of death: a heaven-like plane that most mortals will go to, and a plane of rehabilitation, explicitly meant to teach mortals the errors of their ways upon death so they can go to the proper afterlife. She also serves as a grim reaper-like guide, taking souls to their proper resting place.

## Haneul, Patron of Skymeet

**Alignment**: Lawful Good

**Domain**: Knowledge

**Great Work**: After seeing the city of Skymeet becoming overcrowded, created and permanently raised a second tier to the city to float above the city for all time. Also did a great deal of research at THe Academy, contributing heavily to the understanding of magic on Aiti.

## Aurinko, Bringer of Light

**Alignment**: True Neutral

**Domain**: Light

**Great Work**: Created the sun and the day/night cycle. Oldest of the Great Mages.

## Nithara, the Diligent

**Alignment**: True Neutral

**Domain**: Work and Diligence

**Great Work**: Created the school of abjuration magic. 

Old folk tales say that she visits the forests every autumn to thank the trees for a job well done and turns the leaves beautiful as a reward. People drink cider to worship her, and stuff lavender and amethyst in their pockets to curry her favour when they want the stamina to get things done without tiring out. She's usually depicted as a pale woman with very long, silver hair. Her eyes are always closed,a nd she has a serene look on her face.
