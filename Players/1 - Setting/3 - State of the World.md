# Aiti Now

Ten years have passed since the death of The Life and the destruction of the Portal of Portals. Teleportation and spatial manipulation magic has been slowly rediscovered, but it is still the domain of more powerful magic users. The protective shield around the planet that keeps The Unrealized out has begun to weaken.

## Learning

When the Portal of Portals was created, the knowledge of teleportation magic was mostly lost, except for short-range spells like _misty step_. When the Portal of Portals was destroyed, rather than become despondent, the schools of magic poured their energies into rediscovering the magic of teleportation. There are many wizards who are so devoted to the study and practice that they have lost the ability to cast any other spells, but can cast gate spells at will.
