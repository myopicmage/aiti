## Land of the Water

### Elva of the Water, the Depressed Queen

Currently queen of the Land of the Water, Elva suffers from fairly severe depression. Her husband died several years ago, and she hasn't been quite the same since. Her two children and her entire court beg her fairly often to relinquish the throne and seek help, but she is convinced that ruling is all she has. She pours all of her effort and energy into maintaining her kingdom, often getting involved in matters far below the necessity of requiring the involvement of the queen, but she needs to stay busy.

When not meddling in the affairs of the common folk and her court, Elva can occasionally be found training with her sailors, and is actually an accomplished ship captain. Some say she is a reasonably powerful storm sorcerer, but she will not confirm or deny this.
