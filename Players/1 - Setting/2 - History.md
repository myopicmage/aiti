# History

The future is always informed by the past, and the best way to understand what's happening now is to understand what has already happened. 

## The Distant Past

### Piileva

Aiti was once an Unrealized, a denizen of the plane called Piileva. Not quite chaos, not quite empty space, Piileva is a plane of potential, a place full of things that have all the power to become something great, but not the knowledge of how. Invisible spirits, called the Unrealized, wander through the emptiness, not conscious of their power or potential, simply wandering. Piileva is neither aetherial or astral, chaotic or lawful, elemental or mortal. Piileva is best described as an unborn material plane.

### Aiti

Aiti was a special Unrealized. Through some fluke, either luck, or some divine spark, or just a little bit of chaos, Aiti realised that she had potential. She decided that she wanted to be. And with that tiny thought, she _became_. Where once there was twilight darkness, now there was a massive planet, the first true entity of this new material plane. 

Other Unrealized quickly (though it was difficult to know, as time had not truly begun) followed suit, becoming stars and planets of their own. A slow wave of existence spread through Piileva, and a new plane was born.

Aiti, however, was not content. She _existed_, but that was not enough for her. Focusing her massive will, she created two beings, two children, two gods: one she called The Life, and they were tasked with making new beings. The other she called The Land, and they were tasked with remaking Aiti into new and interesting shapes. For a time, she was content. Her two children took to their tasks with incredible drive, making Aiti into a beautiful planet, full of plants and complex geography, gorgeous mountain ranges, and lush valleys. 

The Life, however, had been born with their mother's ambition as well as her power. Soon, The Life was not content making simple plants. Even the grandest trees failed to hold their interest. They wanted to make something that could move, something that could think. Something interesting.

And so they did.

It is not known what animal The Life created. The story has been told, again and again, over thousands of generations, and over many iterations of The Life. The actual animal doesn't matter, only that it was created with the same connection to Aiti, and Piileva, as The Life. Some say it was a rabbit, and that the sheer fact of its existence scared it into willing a gate to another plane into existence. Some say it was a fish who created an ocean. Aiti, however, knew that something was Wrong. She had crafted her two children by her own will out of herself, but now one of her children had crafted something of her without her knowledge or consent.

Aiti was furious, and demanded that The Life unmake what they had made. The Life, not knowing what would happen next, complied.

And thus, Aiti knew death.

A piece of her, created without her knowledge or consent, was now simply _missing_. There was a hole in her existence, and it was **wrong**. The Life did not understand Aiti's reaction, as their connection to the animal was filtered through Aiti. They simply felt echoes of loss, and wanted to continue with their experiments.

Aiti initially refused, but relented after a time, provided that there was no direct connection between her and the lesser beings created by The Life. So The Life began to create animals, who had no connection to Aiti or Piileva. They could not use magic, the gift given by the will of Aiti. 

More and more complex animals were made, but none of them could think, and were therefore less and less interesting over time. The Life tried to make stranger and stronger animals to stave off the boredom, making animals that could survive the harsh environments that The Land had taken to crafting, or making animals with some measure of magical ability.

Eventually, though, The Life took a risk and made a creature that could think.

The first human had been born.
