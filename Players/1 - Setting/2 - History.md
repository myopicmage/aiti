# History

The future is always informed by the past, and the best way to understand what's happening now is to understand what has already happened. 

## The Distant Past

### Piileva

Aiti was once an Unrealized, a denizen of the plane called Piileva. Not quite chaos, not quite empty space, Piileva is a plane of potential, a place full of things that have all the power to become something great, but not the knowledge of how. Invisible spirits, called the Unrealized, wander through the emptiness, not conscious of their power or potential, simply wandering. Piileva is neither aetherial or astral, chaotic or lawful, elemental or mortal. Piileva is best described as an unborn material plane.

### Aiti

Aiti was a special Unrealized. Through some fluke, either luck, or some divine spark, or just a little bit of chaos, Aiti realized that she had potential. She decided that she wanted to be. And with that tiny thought, she _became_. Where once there was twilight darkness, now there was a massive planet, the first true entity of this new material plane. 

Other Unrealized quickly (though it was difficult to know, as time had not truly begun) followed suit, becoming stars and planets of their own. A slow wave of existence spread through Piileva, and a new plane was born.

Aiti, however, was not content. She _existed_, but that was not enough for her. Focusing her massive will, she created two beings, two children, two gods: one she called The Life, and they were tasked with making new beings. The other she called The Land, and they were tasked with remaking Aiti into new and interesting shapes. For a time, she was content. Her two children took to their tasks with incredible drive, making Aiti into a beautiful planet, full of plants and complex geography, gorgeous mountain ranges, and lush valleys. 

The Life, however, had been born with their mother's ambition as well as her power. Soon, The Life was not content making simple plants. Even the grandest trees failed to hold their interest. They wanted to make something that could move, something that could think. Something interesting.

And so they did.

It is not known what animal The Life created. The story has been told, again and again, over thousands of generations, and over many iterations of The Life. The actual animal doesn't matter, only that it was created with the same connection to Aiti, and Piileva, as The Life. Some say it was a rabbit, and that the sheer fact of its existence scared it into willing a gate to another plane into existence. Some say it was a fish who created an ocean. Aiti, however, knew that something was Wrong. She had crafted her two children by her own will out of herself, but now one of her children had crafted something of her without her knowledge or consent.

Aiti was furious, and demanded that The Life unmake what they had made. The Life, not knowing what would happen next, complied.

And thus, Aiti knew death.

A piece of her, created without her knowledge or consent, was now simply _missing_. There was a hole in her existence, and it was **wrong**. The Life did not understand Aiti's reaction, as their connection to the animal was filtered through Aiti. They simply felt echoes of loss, and wanted to continue with their experiments.

Aiti initially refused, but relented after a time, provided that there was no direct connection between her and the lesser beings created by The Life. So The Life began to create animals, who had no connection to Aiti or Piileva. They could not use magic, the gift given by the will of Aiti. 

More and more complex animals were made, but none of them could think, and were therefore less and less interesting over time. The Life tried to make stranger and stronger animals to stave off the boredom, making animals that could survive the harsh environments that The Land had taken to crafting, or making animals with some measure of magical ability.

Eventually, though, The Life took a risk and made a creature that could think.

The first human had been born.

Aiti was thrilled, and asked for more. These were beings who could think and feel just like The Life and The Land and Aiti herself, but they were small and disconnected from the elder god. Carefully, The Life gave a bit of themselves to each human, so they, too, could wield the power of Aiti, albeit in a much weaker form. 

Initially, The Land agreed to give some of their power to the humans as well, forming an equal partnership. Half of the humans would draw from The Life, and half from The Land. Balance was found, and the humans thrived. Aiti, her children, and her children's children were happy. 

### The Other Unrealized

Aiti was special, not just because she was the first of the Unrealized to will herself into existence, but also because she was one of the few Unrealized who had the strength of will to _maintain_ her existence. Over time, many Unrealized blinked in and out of existence, most of them never progressing past the initial stage of being born as a planet or a star. A few of them became strange, misshapen creatures, unable to exist in Piileva, and so they retreated to other planes. It is said that some of them became fiends.

Some of the Unrealized chose to use their will to exist, but in a different fashion. They became creatures of light, and ascended to the divine realms to watch over their former brethren. 

One Unrealized, on seeing what Aiti had become, became overzealous in their attempts to mimic the elder planet. This spirit took a name, Fey, and created countless creatures, each one tied to each other and Fey herself. This was too much for Fey to handle. She had taken on too much, too quickly. Her strong will held her together, but she could not remain in Piileva, and she fell through the cosmic aether, landing in a friendlier environment, and becoming the Feywild.

Still other Unrealized attempted to follow the trail that Aiti had blazed, some of them even creating life of their own. Many other creatures were created, some of them sentient, some of them not. But they were not to last. Their stars could not maintain the will to exist, and wished to return to their simpler, Unrealized state. 

Aiti watched as one star simply gave up, taking all of the life that had lived on its surface back into an Unrealized state with it. She remembered the feeling of death, and knew she could not allow this to happen anymore. With her great will, she reached out to the minds of her fellow denizens of Piileva, and made an offer: if you cannot continue, give me your children.

Over time, more and more of the Unrealized who tried what Aiti did gave up, and Aiti took on all of their children. She saved the Elves from a planet on the brink of exhaustion. She saved the Gnomes from a planet on the brink of madness. Several of her brethren did not even need reasons, they simply wished to give up. Aiti's population grew and grew, but there was plenty of room and resources to spare.

## The War

As Aiti's population grew, and as Aiti accepted the children of her less-capable brethren, each mortal gained the ability to use the gifts of Aiti, to wield her magic. They drew this power through The Life and The Land, who had maintained their balance, but now there were so many people using so much magic that The Land had begun to notice ill effects. Once, when they raised their hand, huge mountains would spring out of the ground. Now, they were smaller, and they grew smaller with every passing day.

The Land pleaded with Aiti and The Life: stop giving everyone power. Give us more power. Anything to continue to work as they once had.

The Life was sympathetic, and agreed with the request for more power, but Aiti either did not know how, or was unwilling to grant it. The Life simply went on, but The Land was not satisfied. They began to plot. Slowly, carefully, so as not to be noticed, The Land convinced ten generals, masters of their chosen schools of magic, to lead armies. Those armies would thin the ranks of the mortals, returning the power that rightfully belonged to The Land.

The war was surprisingly quick, barely long enough to be called a war. Within a week, The Land's armies had been decimated. The Life, reacting quickly to the threat, transferred all of the mortals drawing power from them to The Land, reducing their power to a fraction of what it once was. The ten generals, masters of their craft that they were, could not withstand the magical might and superior numbers of those who sided with The Life.

In the end, The Life and The Land fought, a titanic battle that left permanent scars on the surface of Aiti. The Life was ready to land a killing blow, but Aiti stopped them. Death was out of the question. Instead, all mortals would permanently draw their power from The Land, and The Land would be shackled, chained, imprisoned, deep within the bowels of Aiti. The ten generals pleaded for their lives, and were granted something of a reprieve. Instead of being executed, they would have their personalities erased, but their magical knowledge maintained. They would become immortal, and they would be moved to a new plane, a mindscape, where those who sought knowledge could ask for advice from those who were masters of the craft.

Aiti decreed that The Land would be forgotten, and tried to praise The Life for their part in preventing catastrophe. The Life, however, could not live with the knowledge they had. With Aiti's permission, they transferred their power and memories to a chosen mortal, making them the new Life, thus establishing the cycle of The Life. Every few hundred years, The Life will transfer their power to a new mortal, allowing for a new perspective, and a new guiding hand over the world.

## Peace

Without The Land to constantly reshape the face of Aiti, the world became a calmer place. The Life proved a very capable guiding hand, making sure that the mortals could live their lives, and govern themselves, but also preventing any major conflicts that might have turned into anything resembling a war. Aiti and her people prospered.

Aiti, however, grew lonely, and a little bit bored. She was unable to communicate directly with any mortal, and having only The Life to talk to could grow uninteresting, especially if The Life was busy with mortal affairs. So she began to choose random mortals, and give them direct connections to her power. They gained the ability to talk to her, and to wield god-like powers, nearly as powerful as The Life. These mortals were few and far between, but each one performed some sort of Great Work before their power was too great for them to stay on Aiti. People began to worship these Great Mages, asking them for power, or help, or guidance. Occasionally, they would even respond. No one is certain where they went, but it is said that some of them occasionally come back to Aiti to check on things.
