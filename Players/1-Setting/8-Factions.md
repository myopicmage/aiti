# Factions

Though Aiti was once a peaceful world, there have always been disagreements, and people have always gravitated toward those with similar ideas. In the ten years since the death of The Life, these factions have grown stronger, and now have a larger presence in the world.

## Children of The Life

**Alignment**: Chaotic Good

**Base of operations**: Canopy

**Leader**: Currently unknown

Through the cycle of rebirth, The Life would choose a person to transfer their power to every so often. Potential candidates were offered the chance to become a Child of The Life. They would be blessed with a small amount of The Life's power, and would usually join the other candidates in Canopy. They served as The Life's eyes and ears in the world, venturing out to perform acts of good that didn't require The Life's personal attention. Though their order operates in the open, they're still considered mysterious and strange, as the members always seem distant, as if distracted by some unseen entity.

Before the death of The Life, being offered a chance to join the Children was considered an honour, but their place in the world has come heavily into question as of late. Without their patron, they continue to work as they did before, but they have become more distant, and less approachable. They still handle the same sort of issues as they always have, but many wonder who is giving them their orders. They appear out of nowhere, as they are still blessed with The Life's power, solve the perceived problem, and leave just as quickly as they arrived. 

Many claim that members of the Children are becoming increasingly erratic over time. The Children claim that they still have a leader and still know their way, but it is difficult to be certain, since no new members can join and much of the internal communication is telepathic.
