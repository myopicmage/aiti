      You beg the elements to come to your aid, summoning either a sustained wind
      or a powerful gust in a line in front of you. Though this spell is meant to drive 
      personal glider carriages, it can be focused into a powerful blast of air. 
    </p>
    <p>
      When cast as a regular spell, this spell summons a powerful blast of wind, focused
      in a line in front of you. Targets must make a dexterity saving throw. On a 
      failed save, they take 1d6 bludgeoning damage and are knocked prone. On a successful
      save, they take half as much damage and are not knocked prone.
    </p>
    <p>
      When cast as a ritual, this spell summons a continuous stream of wind for up
      to 12 hours that you can use to power a personal glider that carries up to 
      4 passengers (not including you).
    </p>

      <b>At higher levels</b>: This spell increases in damage by 1d6 for each level
      above first.
