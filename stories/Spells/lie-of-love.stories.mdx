    A creature of your choice that you share a lane within range that shares a
    language with you. They must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or fall
    helplessly in love with you for the duration of the spell. The creature
    becomes your ally, and will obey commands you give them so long as you say
    them as a lover would. They will fiercely protect you should you come under
    attack by anyone. They will also become jealous if you do not speak to them
    at least once every ten minutes. The spell ends after the duration is over,
    or if you damage the creature. Once the spell is over, the creature becomes
    hostile, and knows that it has been enchanted.
