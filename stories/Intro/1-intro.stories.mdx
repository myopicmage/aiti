# The World of Aiti

Welcome to the world of Aiti. Aiti is both a living planet, and the name of the setting, so all 
of the associated places in the multiverse as well.

As a campaign setting, Aiti should feel like a semi-modern world, with many of the conveniences 
that we're used to, but one with a lot more magic, and just a little bit more chaos. 

## The environment

There are some stories (_cough_ Dune _cough_) that take place on worlds with a single environment,
where everything is basically the same, and there's no ecological variety. This is not one of those
worlds. Aiti the planet is rich and full of differing ecosystems. There are vast oceans, huge grasslands,
mountain ranges, islands, the works. 

## Politics 

The world, politically, is divided into Lands, which are basically kingdoms, or city-states. The borders
are ill-defined, and don't match up nicely with any geographical landmarks. The further away from a 
capital city, the more political affiliation becomes a question of culture more than location. Until recently,
the borders didn't matter much, but as time goes on, trust dwindles.

## Races

Though The Life originally created humans, she readily accepted the creations of the other Unrealized as
they gave up trying to hold onto their reality. Over time, the races began to mix, and now each city can 
boast a healthy population of every race. 

Alignments, especially, differ from the forgotten realms. There are no evil races. Alignments are
on a purely individual basis. Traditionally evil races, such as orcs, goblins, or tieflings, are welcomed
with open arms, as they are just differently shaped people to the denizens of Aiti.

Each race, as they were brought from their original home, came with original pieces of their home worlds,
in a very literal sense. There are ancestral homes for essentially everyone, many of them with their own thriving
cities and populations.

## Magic

On Aiti, everyone is at least a little bit magical, and magic is infused into every aspect 
of daily life. Self-sweeping brooms, bookshelves that sort themselves, all sorts of flights 
of fancy are common and appreciated.

However, this does not mean that non-magical skills are unappreciated. Artisans and craftspeople 
are also highly valued.

Everyone knows that magic is a gift from, and an extension of, Aiti herself, and so there's always 
some reverence paid. Earth elemental magic is uncommon, though it is used. Some people are very thankful 
for their gifts, but many take them for granted.
