# Before Your Campaign Begins

It has been generations upon generations since The War. The Land has been forgotten, 
countless cycles of The Life have taken place, and there have been many Great Mages. 
One of the Great Mages created the Portal of Portals, a device which allowed anyone, 
anywhere on Aiti, to teleport anywhere with the ease of snapping their finger. Life 
was not paradise, but it was good. 

Ten years before your campaign begins, however, was the **last** cycle of The Life. 
During the ceremony, the mortal who was to accept the powers of The Life was killed, 
and the power simply vanished. No one knows who killed the mortal, and no one knows 
what happened to the power of The Life. Aiti has not raised up a Great Mage in at 
least ten generations, and it doesn't seem like she's likely to do it again anytime 
soon.

Soon after the death of The Life, the Portal of Portals was destroyed, bringing the 
world to a standstill. Chaos reigned for a short time, as the knowledge of how to 
teleport without the Portal of Portals had been lost to the archives of the 
libraries, and more mundane means of travel had not been developed. 

A few years after the calamity, the catastrophe, the Death, the sundering (the event 
goes by many names), people realized that one of The Life's duties was keeping The 
Unrealized out. Portals have begun appearing at random, few and far between, 
thankfully, but Unrealized have been wandering in, and suddenly finding themselves 
with mostly random forms.

In the intervening years, people have learned to compensate for the lack of deity and
easy transport, though the peace that the world once enjoyed has been slowly fraying.
Lack of cheap, instant communication has increased tensions across the world, and the
fact that there is no longer a mediator decidedly higher in authority than the rulers
of the individual Lands has brought the ability to properly negotiate into question.
There seems to be little chance of outright war, but tensions have been slowly rising.

## Learning

When the Portal of Portals was created, the knowledge of teleportation magic was 
mostly lost, except for short-range spells like _misty step_. 

When the Portal of Portals was destroyed, rather than become despondent, the schools 
of magic poured their energies into rediscovering the magic of teleportation. There 
are many wizards who are so devoted to the study and practice that they have lost 
the ability to cast any other spells, but can cast gate spells at will.

## Transport

There are a few ways to travel around the world of Aiti. The simplest, cheapest, and 
most common is a horse-drawn cart, but there are other, more exotic means of travel.
Here are some of them, presented in no particular order.

### City portals

Should your party be rich, well-connected, or lucky, there are usually portals or gates
to be found between the major cities. They are usually very expensive for the general
public, or may require the approval of a high-level administrator. On particularly busy
days, the Queen herself approves travel through the gates of Skymeet.

### Glider carriage

Soon after the destruction of the portal of portals, Hamish Labarthance of Delta began adapting
the work of the sailors of the Land of the Water to a more land-friendly approach. 
Traditionally, each ship had been crewed by not only sailors, but some sort of magic
user skilled in wind magics, so they were not wholly reliant on the weather. Labarthance built
special rails and created a spell which allowed a carriage to float above them, creating
a train-like carriage that could be powered by a mage, similarly to how wind mages would
power the ships of the Land of the Water. 

Soon after he debuted his invention, rail lines were built between the major cities, and glider
carriages were running between them with some regularity. Trade and travel resumed, but
Labarthance did not live to see his invention be truly realised. 

### Private glider

Once the glider carriages were being built, one of the wizards working with Labarthance began
to adapt the spell that made the rails possible for use with other objects. It took a few years,
but eventually he created a platform similar to a small boat, with a levitation spell beneath it, 
that could be powered by a single mage, instead of the two to three required for a whole carriage.
The spell to levitate the personal gliders ended up being fairly simple, though the gliders themselves
remain mostly unavailable to the masses, due to the relative difficulty of piloting them, and
the price of training.
