# The World of Aiti

Welcome to the world of Aiti. Aiti is both a living planet, and the name of the setting, so all of the associated places in the multiverse as well.

As a campaign setting, Aiti should feel like a semi-modern world, with many of the conveniences that we're used to, but one with a lot more magic, and just a little bit more chaos. 

## Magic

On Aiti, everyone is at least a little bit magical, and magic is infused into every aspect of daily life. Self-sweeping brooms, bookshelves that sort themselves, all sorts of flights of fancy are common and appreciated.

However, this does not mean that non-magical skills are unappreciated. Artisans and craftspeople are also highly valued.

Everyone knows that magic is a gift from, and an extension of, Aiti herself, and so there's always some reverence paid. Earth magic is uncommon, though it is used. Some people are very thankful for their gifts, but many take them for granted.
