## Sun's Reach, Land of the Sun

The southern region of Syd√§n is the Land of the Sun. It is a huge grassland, marked with pockets of trees and the
occasional area that might be called a small forest, but it is mainly low, rolling hills and an endless sea of grass.
The Land of the Sun can claim the largest number of smaller cities, towns, and villages compared to the other Lands, 
but they're considerably denser closer to Sun's Reach, the capital. 

Compared to the other Lands, the Land of the Sun also has the best inter-city transport network. The Land
of the Sun was one of the most eager adopters of the glider carriage technology, and there are several rail 
lines between some of the larger cities, but most of the transport uses what has been called "shooting stars." 
Using a special magical circle, a person is wrapped in light and carried to a corresponding circle. The spells and 
enchantments required for this are closely guarded by the Silver Tower, though they are more than willing to set
up the necessary circles for anyone who asks (and pays). They have a name for the setup, but it is never actually used,
since the night sky flashes like shooting stars as people move between areas. 

Sun's Reach itself sits near the southern border of the Land, on a river fairly close to the ocean, though not
as close as Delta. The city is built mostly in the shape of a sunburst, with glider carriage rails leaving
the central circle at regular intervals. The buildings tend to be fairly low. For a very long time, the city planning
philosophy has been "out, not up."

To the northeast of the city is the Silver Tower. It is very purposefully too far to walk, but easily reached by 
glider or, in the past, teleporting. Unlike the rest of the buildings in the Land of the Sun, the Silver Tower is 
extremely tall, and grows a little more each year as new facilities are added. 

Sun's Reach is considered to be a bit aloof and distant by the other Lands, especially since the loss of the Portal of
Portals. Due to their distance from the other cities, and their prime location, there have always been border disputes,
especially with the Land of the Water. Almost all of the grassland is arable, which is something that the Land of the
Water sorely lacks.

## Names

Names in the Land of the Sun typically draw on the Bantu family of languages, such as Swahili or Xhosa.
