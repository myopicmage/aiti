## Skymeet, Land of the Sky

The last of the four great Lands to be founded, Skymeet is the capital city of the Land of the Sky. It sits on the slopes of a mountain range, the bottom 
tier built into the mountains themselves, and the upper tier floating hundreds of feet above, shining like a beacon for miles. The city is a massive 
trading hub, with much of the lower tier dominated by artisans and merchants, and much of the upper tier dominated by The Academy, the second-largest 
school dedicated to the study of magic on Aiti.

The areas around Skymeet are mostly filled with farms, though there is a fair amount of mining. The Land ends quite abruptly at the edge of the Mother 
Forest, as the people have a great deal of respect for the lands within.

Skymeet, and the Land of the Sky, are governed by King Terrence and Queen Miranda, with a court comprised mostly of citizens of note. There isn't a 
noble class to speak of, and most people are invited to the Court for reasons of merit, rather than some sort of luck of being born. In the past, there 
hasn't been much in the way of politics for the sake of politics, but there has been a growing trend of those vying for positions in the Court by 
performing deeds mostly for show, rather than any sort of altruism.

The city of Skymeet itself has a strong affinity for the domain of Knowledge, but the surrounding areas tend to favour Life. Citizens of the city tend 
to pray to Haneul, the Great Mage who raised the upper tier of the city when it was getting overcrowded.
