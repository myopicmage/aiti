## Canopy, Land of the Forest

In the north of the continent of Syd√§n lies the Mother Forest, a huge, untamed wild full of giant trees, lush valleys, and verdant meadows. The
Mother Forest was grown by P'Thael as their Great Work, and it is a safe haven for all those who would call nature their home or companion. It is
home to many druids, some clerics, and is the place The Life calls home. The Mother Forest itself is alive, and almost conscious, and will rearrange
itself as it sees fit, though sometimes Vyr or a mischievous fey will convince it to do so.

Deep within the heart of the Mother Forest, sometimes at the center, sometimes not, Canopy is less a city in the traditional sense and more of
a set of villages in close proximity that decided to work together for the common good. It is dominated by the Greatmother Tree, which since the
death of The Life has become a sort of *de facto* city hall and place of government.

Several enclaves of druids call Canopy and the surrounding areas their home, and the largest remaining enclave of the Children of Life make
their home next to the Greatmother Tree. When The Life was alive and the Portal of Portals still operational, the tree glowed with the constant
magic running through it, but now it almost seems to wilt.

Architecture in Canopy is designed to incorporate the plant life as much as possible. Most houses are made by finding branches that are already
close together and weaving a roof out of dead leaves, then sealing it with magic. There's very little metal in use in Canopy, partly due to the
lack of need, but also due to the druidic aversion to it.

The main patron of Canopy is the unnamed Great Mage who created Canopy, but many will pray to the patron of their particular Circle, or to The Life.

## Names

Names in the Land of the Forest are hard to pin down. Many of the denizens are not originally born there, and many of them are members of orders or
groups that encourage names according to their traditions. 

For character names, it is recommended that you follow the rules in Volo's Guide to Monsters for the Tabaxi, or choose Finnish names.
