# Cities of Aiti

The main continent of Aiti, called Sydän, is easily the largest. It is home to Canopy, the place where The Life called home. The continent is 
dominated by four great Lands, roughly akin to city-states or kingdoms. Until recently, they lived in harmony, but tensions have been rising since the 
loss of their divine mediator.

Each Land is a large, sprawling thing. The capital cities are the largest, and some people will use the name of the city interchangeably with 
the name of the Land. This does not mean that the populations are found entirely in the cities. There are many smaller, outlying cities, towns,
and villages, as well as remote farms or mines. 

Travel within a Land differs. The Land of the Water, being dominated by swamps and marshlands, tends to favour special boats or gliders that 
allow easy travel over water. The Land of the Sun has a fairly extensive network of smaller glider carriage lines. The Land of the Sky is especially 
keen on personal gliders, though there is still a great deal of more mundane travel by horse or horse-drawn carriage, since gliders cannot handle the 
hills and mountains of the region quite as well as legs. The Land of the Forest is difficult to traverse, and so there are many ad-hoc solutions
strung together, mostly involving animals of some sort.

## Between the cities

Aiti is geographically diverse, covered mostly in ocean, but also boasts several continents.
The Land only managed to make Sydän before they were taken down, but many more continents were
brought to Aiti as she accepted the children of her brethren. Most of the other continents
are fairly uniform, consisting mainly of a single city and the surrounding areas of other 
planets. 

On Sydän, however, there's a bit more variety. Broadly speaking, there's swamp and marshland 
in the west, mountains in the east, grasslands in the south, and forest in the north. Only
the areas around the major cities are what could be called densely populated, though there
are denser pockets around some outlying villages.
