## Cities of Aiti

The main continent of Aiti, called Syd√§n, is easily the largest. It is home to Canopy, the place where The Life called home. The continent is 
dominated by four great Lands, roughly akin to city-states or kingdoms. Until recently, they lived in harmony, but tensions have been rising since the 
loss of their divine mediator.
