## Delta, Land of the Water

The Land of the Water is the westernmost area of Sydän, an area full of lakes, rivers, swamps, and marshland. Delta is the capital city, 
named for the river delta on which it sits. Sprawls might be a better term, as the city is rather large, with plenty of extra space for boats. 
Many canals crisscross the city, allowing for easy travel by small boat, or by foot on the many bridges. Even when the Portal of Portals was 
working, people chose mainly to use the canals and walkways, or even occasionally swim.

The city is informally divided into sections or districts, marked mostly by the differing architectures within each area. The Royal District, 
which is located furthest east, sits mostly atop a hill, and is marked by a series of interconnected buildings made of stone, dominated by the 
large castle-like structure in the center. Many of the districts closer to the water are marked by rows of colorful homes, usually with large, 
open windows. Some districts have smaller, compressed rows of apartments, but even these have plenty of windows to let the sea air in.

Easily the largest part of the city, however, is the harbor. There are hundreds of boats coming and going at any moment, with constant work 
happening on the shore and docks. Trade is the city's main source of income, even considering the Portal of Portals. Now that travel and transport 
has to happen by more mundane means, the city is thriving. Most of the inhabitants are taking this in stride, as they're used to staying calm with 
the rapid changes of the sea and weather. There's even a burgeoning enclave of storm sorcerers, who have found their powers extremely helpful 
when it comes to seafaring.

The area surrounding delta is mainly farmland, occasionally dotted with a village. Most travel is done by boat on the rivers, but there's a 
fairly comprehensive system of roads for those less aquatically inclined.

Officially, the city's patron mage is Seònaid, but many also choose to pray to Nithara due to Nithara's more predictable nature.
