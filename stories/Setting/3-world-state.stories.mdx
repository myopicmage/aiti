# Before Your Campaign Begins

It has been generations upon generations since The War. The Land has been forgotten, countless cycles of The Life have taken place, and there have been many Great Mages. One of the Great Mages created the Portal of Portals, a device which allowed anyone, anywhere on Aiti, to teleport anywhere with the ease of snapping their finger. Life was not paradise, but it was good. 

Ten years before your campaign begins, however, was the **last** cycle of The Life. During the ceremony, the mortal who was to accept the powers of The Life was killed, and the power simply vanished. No one knows who killed the mortal, and no one knows what happened to the power of The Life. Aiti has not raised up a Great Mage in at least ten generations, and it doesn't seem like she's likely to do it again anytime soon.

Soon after the death of The Life, the Portal of Portals was destroyed, bringing the world to a standstill. Chaos reigned for a short time, as the knowledge of how to teleport without the Portal of Portals had been lost to the archives of the libraries, and more mundane means of travel had not been developed. 

A few years after the calamity, the catastrophe, the Death, the sundering (the event goes by many names), people realized that one of The Life's duties was keeping The Unrealized out. Portals have begun appearing at random, few and far between, thankfully, but Unrealized have been wandering in, and suddenly finding themselves with mostly random forms.

## Learning

When the Portal of Portals was created, the knowledge of teleportation magic was mostly lost, except for short-range spells like _misty step_. When the Portal of Portals was destroyed, rather than become despondent, the schools of magic poured their energies into rediscovering the magic of teleportation. There are many wizards who are so devoted to the study and practice that they have lost the ability to cast any other spells, but can cast gate spells at will.
