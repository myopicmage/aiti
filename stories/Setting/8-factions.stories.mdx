# Factions

Though Aiti was once a peaceful world, there have always been disagreements, and people 
have always gravitated toward those with similar ideas. In the ten years since the death 
of The Life, these factions have grown stronger, and now have a larger presence in the world.

## Children of The Life

| Alignment    | Home Base | Leader  |
| ------------ | --------- | ------- |
| Chaotic Good | Canopy    | Unknown |

Through the cycle of rebirth, The Life would choose a person to transfer their power 
to every so often. Potential candidates were offered the chance to become a Child 
of The Life. They would be blessed with a small amount of The Life's power, and would 
usually join the other candidates in Canopy. They served as The Life's eyes and ears 
in the world, venturing out to perform acts of good that didn't require The Life's 
personal attention. Though their order operates in the open, they're still 
considered mysterious and strange, as the members always seem distant, as if 
distracted by some unseen entity.

Before the death of The Life, being offered a chance to join the Children was considered 
an honour, but their place in the world has come heavily into question as of late. 
Without their patron, they continue to work as they did before, but they have become 
more distant, and less approachable. They still handle the same sort of issues as they 
always have, but many wonder who is giving them their orders. They appear out of nowhere, 
as they are still blessed with The Life's power, solve the perceived problem, and leave 
just as quickly as they arrived. 

Many claim that members of the Children are becoming increasingly erratic over time. 
The Children claim that they still have a leader and still know their way, but it is 
difficult to be certain, since no new members can join and much of the internal communication 
is telepathic. 

## Moonrise

| Alignment       | Home Base        | Leader                     |
| --------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------- |
| Lawful Evil     | Mother Forest    | Brandal, Druid of the Moon |

A group of like-minded druids who have decided, collectively, that technology is a source of 
evil on Aiti. Over the course of the past ten years, they have worked their way into positions 
where they are well-connected and able to advise those in power. They are inherently distrusting
of non-members, and are extremely secretive about their activities, as their (un)stated goal is
to steer the course of the world in any way they can, so long as it's away from more technology 
being developed. They believe firmly in the power of nature and Aiti, and think technology is a sin
against her.

Their leader, Brandal, is a charismatic Air Genasi who brought most of the original group together.
They're known for their mastery of bird-like shapes, which they put to great use in the flurry of
activity that eventually led to the creation of Moonrise. Brandal does not often leave the Mother 
Forest, but they can usually be found in Canopy, advising the local government.

## Hamish and co.

| Alignment       | Home Base        | Leader                     |
| --------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------- |
| Chaotic Neutral | Delta            | Hamish Labarthance, Jr.    |

Hamish Labarthance invented the glider carriage, and his invention arguably made travel possible
for the masses again. Hamish and co. is a bastardization of this man and his gift to the world. 
Hamish Jr. used the money his father left to him after his father's death to fund research into 
lost teleportation, gate, and portal magics. He created a small company that ruthlessly controls
as much use of the city portals they helped to develop as they possibly can in a relentless pursuit 
of profit. 

The wizards who run the city portals are actually employees (read: basically slaves) of Hamish and co.,
who are worked nearly to death. There have been a few attempts at reform, but none of them have taken,
since Labarthance is extremely well connected and offensively rich. Labarthance has famously stated
that he cares little for the well-being of his employees, preferring to call them "resources," and would
gladly replace them with enchanted items if he could.

Hamish and co. has since branched out from city portals into luxury gliders. Extremely expensive luxury 
gliders. There was a short-lived attempt to corner the market on personal gliders, but they proved to be
too easy to make, and there was no profit to be had.
