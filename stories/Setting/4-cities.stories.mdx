## Cities of Aiti

<Story name="Cities of Aiti">
  <p>
    The main continent of Aiti, called Sydän, is easily the largest. It is home to Canopy, the place where The Life called home. The continent is 
    dominated by four great Lands, roughly akin to city-states or kingdoms. Until recently, they lived in harmony, but tensions have been rising since the 
    loss of their divine mediator.

## Delta, Land of the Water

<Story name="Delta, Land of the Water">
  <div>
    <p>
      The Land of the Water is the westernmost area of Sydän, an area full of lakes, rivers, swamps, and marshland. Delta is the capital city, 
      named for the river delta on which it sits. Sprawls might be a better term, as the city is rather large, with plenty of extra space for boats. 
      Many canals crisscross the city, allowing for easy travel by small boat, or by foot on the many bridges. Even when the Portal of Portals was 
      working, people chose mainly to use the canals and walkways, or even occasionally swim.
    </p>
    <p>
      The city is informally divided into sections or districts, marked mostly by the differing architectures within each area. The Royal District, 
      which is located furthest east, sits mostly atop a hill, and is marked by a series of interconnected buildings made of stone, dominated by the 
      large castle-like structure in the center. Many of the districts closer to the water are marked by rows of colorful homes, usually with large, 
      open windows. Some districts have smaller, compressed rows of apartments, but even these have plenty of windows to let the sea air in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Easily the largest part of the city, however, is the harbor. There are hundreds of boats coming and going at any moment, with constant work 
      happening on the shore and docks. Trade is the city's main source of income, even considering the Portal of Portals. Now that travel and transport 
      has to happen by more mundane means, the city is thriving. Most of the inhabitants are taking this in stride, as they're used to staying calm with 
      the rapid changes of the sea and weather. There's even a burgeoning enclave of storm sorcerers, who have found their powers extremely helpful 
      when it comes to seafaring.
    </p>
    <p>
      The area surrounding delta is mainly farmland, occasionally dotted with a village. Most travel is done by boat on the rivers, but there's a 
      fairly comprehensive system of roads for those less aquatically inclined.
    </p>
    <p>
      Officially, the city's patron mage is Seònaid, but many also choose to pray to Nithara due to Nithara's more predictable nature.

## Canopy, Land of the Forest

<Story name="Canopy, Land of the Forest">
  <div>
    <p>
      In the north of the continent of Sydän lies the Mother Forest, a huge, untamed wild full of giant trees, lush valleys, and verdant meadows. The 
      Mother Forest was grown by P'Thael as their Great Work, and it is a safe haven for all those who would call nature their home or companion. It is 
      home to many druids, some clerics, and is the place The Life calls home. The Mother Forest itself is alive, and almost conscious, and will rearrange 
      itself as it sees fit, though sometimes Vyr or a mischievous fey will convince it to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deep within the heart of the Mother Forest, sometimes at the center, sometimes not, Canopy is less a city in the traditional sense and more of 
      a set of villages in close proximity that decided to work together for the common good. It is dominated by the Greatmother Tree, which since the 
      death of The Life has become a sort of *de facto* city hall and place of government. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Several enclaves of druids call Canopy and the surrounding areas their home, and the largest remaining enclave of the Children of Life make 
      their home next to the Greatmother Tree. When The Life was alive and the Portal of Portals still operational, the tree glowed with the constant 
      magic running through it, but now it almost seems to wilt. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Architecture in Canopy is designed to incorporate the plant life as much as possible. Most houses are made by finding branches that are already 
      close together and weaving a roof out of dead leaves, then sealing it with magic. There's very little metal in use in Canopy, partly due to the 
      lack of need, but also due to the druidic aversion to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main patron of Canopy is the unnamed Great Mage who created Canopy, but many will pray to the patron of their particular Circle, or to The Life.

## Sun's Reach, Land of the Sun

<Story name="Sun\'s Reach, Land of the Sun">
  <ul>
    <li>In the south</li>

    <li>Architecture within Land of the Sun mimics buildings and structures within interconnected cities and metropolitan areas. Travel between the smaller cities are facilitated by use of magics to turn people into flashes of light and transporting themselves from one area to another; at night, travelers can be seen mimicking shooting stars of streaking meteors in the sky</li>

## Skymeet, Land of the Sky

<Story name="Skymeet, Land of the Sky">
  <div>
    <p>
      The last of the four great Lands to be founded, Skymeet is the capital city of the Land of the Sky. It sits on the slopes of a mountain range, the bottom 
      tier built into the mountains themselves, and the upper tier floating hundreds of feet above, shining like a beacon for miles. The city is a massive 
      trading hub, with much of the lower tier dominated by artisans and merchants, and much of the upper tier dominated by The Academy, the second-largest 
      school dedicated to the study of magic on Aiti.
    </p>
    <p>
      The areas around Skymeet are mostly filled with farms, though there is a fair amount of mining. The Land ends quite abruptly at the edge of the Mother 
      Forest, as the people have a great deal of respect for the lands within.
    </p>
    <p>
      Skymeet, and the Land of the Sky, are governed by King Terrence and Queen Miranda, with a court comprised mostly of citizens of note. There isn't a 
      noble class to speak of, and most people are invited to the Court for reasons of merit, rather than some sort of luck of being born. In the past, there 
      hasn't been much in the way of politics for the sake of politics, but there has been a growing trend of those vying for positions in the Court by 
      performing deeds mostly for show, rather than any sort of altruism.
    </p>
    <p>
      The city of Skymeet itself has a strong affinity for the domain of Knowledge, but the surrounding areas tend to favour Life. Citizens of the city tend 
      to pray to Haneul, the Great Mage who raised the upper tier of the city when it was getting overcrowded.
