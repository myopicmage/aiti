## Sun Bow

This item appears to be a wand with carvings of the sun. Some of the suns
are represented by dull rubies. It feels heavier than it should, and appears to be 
made of an unfamiliar wood.

Once attuned to the bow, the rubies become luminescent, you gain proficiency with the Moon Bow,
and you gain access to its abilities. As a bonus action, you may transform the wand into a magical
longbow. The wand extends and bends into the shape of an intricately carved bow, and a string 
of sunlight forms between the two ends. This bow does not require arrows. Arrows of sunlight 
will form when the bow is drawn.

You gain a +2 bonus to Attack and Damage rolls with this weapon, which deals radiant damage instead of
piercing damage. 

The bow emits soft light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet. 
The light is sunlight. While the bow persists, you can use an action to expand or reduce its radius 
of bright and dim light by 5 feet each, to a maximum of 30 feet each or a minimum of 10 feet each.
