## Moon Bow

This item appears to be a wand with carvings of the moon. Some of the carvings are inlaid with
dull opals. It feels heavier than it should, and appears to be made of an unfamiliar wood.

Once attuned to the bow, the opals become luminescent, you gain proficiency with the Moon Bow,
and you gain access to its abilities. As a bonus action, you may transform the wand into a magical
longbow. The wand extends and bends into the shape of an intricately carved bow, and a string 
of moonlight forms between the two ends. This bow does not require arrows. Arrows of moonlight 
will form when the bow is drawn.

You gain a +2 bonus to Attack and Damage rolls with this weapon, which deals force damage instead of
piercing damage. 

The bow emits soft light in a 60-foot radius. The light is moonlight. While the blade
persists, you can use an action to brighten or dim the light. The light can become as bright as day, or
low enough to require darkvision. Friendly targets standing in the aura have advantage on saves against
any fear effects.
