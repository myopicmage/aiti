# Differences from vanilla 5e

Aiti is a world full of magic in a newborn universe, so there's a few extra rules 
you can choose to play with.

## Spell slots

For every class except Warlock, increase your number of 1st, 2nd, and 3rd level spell 
slots by your proficiency bonus. Warlocks can increase their number of spell slots by 
their proficiency bonus no matter the level.
