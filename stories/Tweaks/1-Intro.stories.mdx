# Differences from vanilla 5e

Aiti is a world full of magic in a newborn universe, so there's a few extra rules 
you can choose to play with.

## Spell slots

For every class except warlocks, instead of regaining spell slots after a long rest, 
regain all of them after every fight.

For warlocks, your rules are the same, but increase your number of available spell slots
by your proficiency bonus.
