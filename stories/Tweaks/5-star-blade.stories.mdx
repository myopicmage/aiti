## Star Blade

This item appears to be a bracelet inlaid with multiple gemstones. The stones are dull and unpolished.
It does not react to you if you are not attuned.

Once attuned, however, the stones become luminescent, glowing especially brightly at night. You also 
gain access to the blade's abilities, as well as proficiency with the Star Blade. As a bonus action, 
you can extend or retract a blade of stars from the bracelet. While the blade exists, the sword has
the Finesse property. 

You gain a +2 bonus to Attack and Damage Rolls made with this weapon, which deals magical piercing damage 
instead of slashing damage. Damage for this sword is calculated by rolling 4d4 and taking the highest 
3 rolls, then adding your modifiers.

The sword's luminous blade emits light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet. 
 While the blade persists, you can use an action to expand or reduce its radius 
of bright and dim light by 5 feet each, to a maximum of 30 feet each or a minimum of 10 feet each.
