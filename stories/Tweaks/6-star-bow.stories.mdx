## Star Bow

This item appears to be a wand with carvings of the stars. Some of the stars
are represented by various dull gems. It feels heavier than it should, and appears to be 
made of an unfamiliar wood.

Once attuned to the bow, the gems become luminescent, you gain proficiency with the Star Bow,
and you gain access to its abilities. As a bonus action, you may transform the wand into a magical
longbow. The wand extends and bends into the shape of an intricately carved bow, and a string 
of stars forms between the two ends. This bow does not require arrows. Arrows of stars 
will form when the bow is drawn.

You gain a +2 bonus to Attack and Damage rolls with this weapon, which deals magical piercing damage.
Additionally, if the arrow successfully hits a target, it deals 1d4 magical piercing damage to all 
enemies in a 10 foot radius from the target.

The bow emits soft light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet. 
 While the bow persists, you can use an action to expand or reduce its radius 
of bright and dim light by 5 feet each, to a maximum of 30 feet each or a minimum of 10 feet each.
