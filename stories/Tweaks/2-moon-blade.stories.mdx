## Moon Blade

This item appears to be the hilt of a rapier, with a dull opal set into the pommel. It does not react 
if you are not attuned. 

Once attuned, however, the opal becomes luminescent, glowing especially brightly at night. You also 
gain access to the blade's abilities, as well as proficiency with the Moon Blade. As a bonus action, 
you can extend or retract a blade of moonlight from the hilt. While the blade exists, the sword has
the Finesse property. 

You gain a +2 bonus to Attack and Damage Rolls made with this weapon, which deals force damage 
instead of slashing damage. 

The sword's luminous blade emits light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet. 
The light is moonlight. While the blade persists, you can use an action to expand or reduce its radius 
of bright and dim light by 5 feet each, to a maximum of 30 feet each or a minimum of 10 feet each. Friendly
targets standing in either the bright or dim light have advantage on saves against any fear effects.
