# Races of Aiti

On Aiti, there are no evil races. People of all races, creeds, and religions have lived in harmony for generations, 
though that peace is slowly starting to break.

**Traditionally evil player races, such as Orcs and Tieflings, are not evil by default. They are welcomed everywhere with open arms, and treated the same as every other race.**
